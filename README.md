# Predicting Employee Churn Using Machine Learning

## 🚀 Project Overview

Employee retention is a crucial concern for organizations. This project applies machine learning to predict employee churn, helping businesses take proactive steps to improve retention and reduce turnover costs. Using exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, and predictive modeling, this project uncovers key insights that drive employee attrition.

### 🎯 Key Features

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Uncover patterns in employee data with visualizations.

- **Feature Engineering:** Extract meaningful insights from raw data.

- **Machine Learning Models:** Train and compare multiple classifiers (Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, XGBoost, etc.).

- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Optimize models for higher accuracy.

- **Performance Evaluation:** Use precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC to measure effectiveness.

- **Actionable Insights:** Provide recommendations to reduce churn.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Programming Language:** Python 🐍

- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, XGBoost
